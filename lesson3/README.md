# Lesson 3
Hello... this lesson 3 i make simple one digit calculator that i named “owncalc”

Why i use owncalc instead i make whole project named as lesson 3?
Just to lazy to import and re-sync gradle... it took forever for my laptop

Why your code is perfectly same as the lecturer?
I absent in this lesson (LOL) ... don’t be mad i added some more code to make it look “difference” (nope not for differentiate.. just the way i learn code)
